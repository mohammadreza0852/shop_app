A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## How to run
first install flutter sdk [read docs from here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
clone the project and connect your device to your computer. you can also use amulators from android studio.
Now you can use your online shop :)

The attached files **do NOT work as a standalone project** .Instead, you should use them to compare my code(in the lib/ folder, as well as the pubspec.yaml file) to your code. Experience shows, that this helps you spot + fix 99% of all errors you might encounter.If you want to **run the code**, you can do that as well though. Follow these steps1) Create a new Flutter project via flutter create some_project2) Replace the lib/ folder and the pubspec.yaml file with the attached files3) Possibly add assets like images or fonts or adjust the AndroidManifest.xml / Info.plist file to add data/ permissions (only if covered in the previous lectures)4) flutter packages get5) flutter run (with a running emulator or real device connected to your machine)to view the app

## More info
This project uses firebase as its server side. So if you are in Iran you should probably use vpn :)
